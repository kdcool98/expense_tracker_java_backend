1) To run the project run :

        (OR)

(If we want to run the server on default 8080 PORT, or, if the port if aready specified application.properites as server.port=8181)

NOTE ::::: Currently, the port is 8181 and is already set in application.properties for this project.


2) SWAGGER URL :
-> Documentation URL in JSON Format : http://localhost:8181/v3/api-docs

-> Swagger UI URL : http://localhost:8181/swagger-ui/index.html#/

NOTE :::::: As springfox swagger doesn't support above spring boot 3, I used open Api to integrate swagger. dependency used is -
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
Just add this dependency, start the server and open the URL mentioned above


3) DATABASE :
-> MongoDB is being used in this project. The DB cluster is being hosted by Mongo Atlas.
-> Configured and integrated MongoDB using MongoRepository. (Another option was to use Mongo Template, but for that I had to do some configurations, initialize the MongoClient, and return the mongoTemplate)
-> DB name is 'test'
-> There are 2 collections right now : 'incomes', 'expenses'
